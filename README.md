# ILinkedList

This is a program called LinkedList in which I created seven different methods. These methods are: append, detach, insert, get, set, last, next, after, and setNext. 

Append is designed to take in a LinkedList element and add it to the END of the current LinkedList.
Detach is designed to disconnect the first element from the remaining list of elements. It then returns the rest of the list to the person running the program.
Insert is designed to take in a LinkedList element and then add it to the BEGINNING of the current LinkedList.
Get is designed to return the value of the current element or element specified by the user.
Set is designed to set the value of the current element to whatever you want to set/change it to.
Last is designed to return the last element in the LinkedList.
Next is designed to return the next element in the LinkedList.
After is designed to return the whatever element is specified by the parameters.
setNext is designed to take in a LinkedList element as a parameter and set it as the next element in the list. 

In addition to creating these methods, I created test methods for each one of them. Some of the methods had multiple test and that was to ensure that they are working in every possible case.
